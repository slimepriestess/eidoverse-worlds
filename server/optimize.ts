// optimize — the store's diet.
//
// Uploaded GLBs (drag-drop, Orrery/Tripo conjures) used to be served exactly
// as they arrived: raw multi-megabyte meshes with 2K PNG textures, paid in
// full by EVERY client on EVERY first load, forever — the library got a
// draco+webp mirror on day one (~30x) and the store, where all new content
// lands, never did.
//
// This is the same proven recipe, programmatic: dedup + prune + resample +
// webp@1024 + draco. Originals are NEVER touched (append-only doctrine; they
// are the provenance the hash names). Optimized copies live in
// assets/opt/store-min/<hash>.glb and /library serving prefers them.
//
// ⚠️ RUN AS A SUBPROCESS (see CLI below). Draco and image encoding are
// CPU-seconds of synchronous wasm — inside the sequencer process they would
// freeze pose relay and every world for the duration. server.ts spawns
// `bun run server/optimize.ts <in> <out>` per file, one at a time.
//
// VRMs are deliberately NOT run through this pipeline: their springbone/MToon
// extension data has not been proven through it, and a corrupted body is a
// much worse day than a heavy one. The ONE thing a VRM gets is §20c's
// --ktx2-vrm surgical texture rewrite below — raw container work that never
// constructs a Document, swaps image bytes only, and byte-preserves
// everything else (no draco, no prune, no resample on bodies, ever).

// ---- ONE libvips per process (#122) -----------------------------------------
// The store's root manifest declares `sharp: ^0.33.5`; @gltf-transform/
// functions reaches sharp through ndarray-pixels, which declares `^0.35.0`.
// The ranges do not intersect, so no installer can dedupe them and BOTH land
// on disk — node_modules/sharp (0.33.5) beside
// node_modules/ndarray-pixels/node_modules/sharp (0.35.3). Importing plain
// "sharp" here therefore loads a SECOND native libvips into a process that
// already has one, and the two disagree about libvips' own enums:
//
//   GLib-GObject-CRITICAL: value "32" of type 'gint' is invalid or out of
//   range for property 'space' of type 'VipsInterpretation'
//   Error: colourspace: parameter space not set   (sharp/lib/output.js)
//
// On win32 that THROWS, which is the merciful outcome — the pass dies and the
// original is kept. On the show box's libvips it does not throw: encoding
// returns a buffer of uninitialized memory (a repeated LE uint32, then
// zeros), gltf-transform stamps it `image/webp`, and the store serves an
// image that is not an image. That is #122 — the threshold-lantern's
// baseColor and normal (both JPEG-sourced, so both routed through the
// converting path) came out undecodable, the material fell back to
// baseColorFactor 1,1,1,1, and the lantern rendered white.
//
// So: never import "sharp" by bare specifier in this file. Resolve the copy
// @gltf-transform/functions itself will use, and hand that same module back
// to it as the encoder — one libvips, end to end.
//
// RESOLUTION and IMPORT are kept separate, and the bare specifier is reached
// on exactly one condition: no nested copy could be RESOLVED. That means a
// deduped (or single-copy) install, where the bare import is the same single
// copy and is therefore safe.
//
// A nested copy that resolves but fails to IMPORT — ABI mismatch, missing
// dylib, damaged install — must NOT fall back (#136 review). Doing so loads
// the root copy beside the one gltf-transform already has and recreates the
// exact two-libvips condition this module exists to forbid, in the one
// situation where things are already going wrong. It fails closed instead:
// the rejection propagates, both callers skip the texture pass, and a
// draco-only result ships. Less compression is a cost; an image that is not
// an image is a lie.

// VRMC_vrm, VRMC_materials_mtoon, VRMC_springBone, VRMC_node_constraint…) —
// one round-trip through a Document and the body loses its springs, its face,
// its humanoid. So a VRM never touches a Document: raw GLB container work
// where the ONLY mutations are (a) image bytes swapped for their KTX2
// encodes, (b) the bufferView byteOffsets/byteLengths that move implies, and
// (c) the minimal JSON that declares them (mimeType, KHR_texture_basisu).
// Every bufferView keeps its INDEX and ORDER; accessors, skins, sparse
// blocks, and every VRM/VRMC_* JSON section ride through byte-untouched. A
// torn VRM is someone's BODY: transcodeVrmKtx2 validates its own output —
// re-parse, per-view byte comparison, untouched-section equality — and

// images: `textureCompress` runs ndarray-pixels' vendored sharp alongside ours,

// hazard documented at ktx2CompressTextures). When that happens the encoder
// returns a buffer, gltf-transform stamps `image/webp` on it, draco packs it,
// and the file ships. Nothing downstream looks, because every consumer trusts
// the mimeType — so the failure surfaces as one asset rendering untextured
// white, days later, in someone's screenshot (#122).
//
// The rule: an optimizer may give up, but it may not emit bytes it has not
// checked. The VRM arm already validates its own output and throws rather than
// return anything questionable; this is the same doctrine for the other arms,
// at the one place where a lie is cheap to detect — the first four bytes.

// ---- KTX2 for loose library images (§20d) -----------------------------------
// Vegetation, sky, and particle textures reach the client as RAW image bytes
// through the Deno-shim file layer (assets.js primeFiles → readFileSync →
// loadImageTexture): ~92.5MB of decoded RGBA uploads for the meadow, a 34MB
// single-frame upload for the 4K starmap alone. The .ktx2 sibling pays that in
// GPU currency — but TWO contracts must be baked at ENCODE time, because
// three's KTX2Loader ignores KTX orientation metadata and the client takes the
// container's word over the call site's:
//   1. THE FLIP. The engine's loadImageTexture contract bakes the vertical
//      flip into the PIXELS (browser flipY convention; tex.flipY stays false
//      so it composes with repeat tiling — UV-authored trim sheets arrive
//      mirrored without it). Every curated-dir call site takes the default
//      flip, so every encode here flips rows before the encoder ever runs.
//      Decoding is pngjs/jpeg-js — pure JS, deterministic on every platform.
//      sharp is deliberately NOT used in this mode: it is broken on the win32
//      dev box (the recorded two-libvips clash), and a flip that silently
//      failed to happen is a vertically mirrored meadow.
//   2. THE TRANSFER. The DFD's OETF must match what the call site's opts.srgb
//      would have set on the raster texture — the client reads colorSpace
//      from the DFD (KTX2Loader parseColorSpace) and must not override it, so
//      a mismatch is a visible lighting error. Classification is by FILENAME,
//      verified against the actual consumers: vegetation.js loadMap,
//      sky_worlds.js readTex, and the client's own emitters.js spriteTexture.
